Copy code
<script>
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
This line adds an event listener to the document object. The event being listened for is 'DOMContentLoaded', which fires when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed by the browser. The second argument is an anonymous function that will be executed when the event occurs. In this case, it's used to set up the following code once the DOM is ready.
javascript
Copy code
const fileInput = document.getElementById('fileInput');
const uploadButton = document.getElementById('uploadButton');
These lines use the document.getElementById() method to select the HTML elements with the IDs 'fileInput' and 'uploadButton'. The variables fileInput and uploadButton now reference these DOM elements, allowing you to manipulate them in your JavaScript code.
javascript
Copy code
uploadButton.addEventListener('click', function () {
This line adds an event listener to the uploadButton element, listening for a 'click' event. When the button is clicked, the anonymous function provided will be executed.
javascript
Copy code
const selectedFile = fileInput.files[0];
This line retrieves the first selected file from the <input> element with the ID 'fileInput'. The files property of an <input type="file"> element is an array-like object containing selected files. Here, you're taking the first file from the array (if any).
javascript
Copy code
if (selectedFile) {
This line checks whether a file has been selected. If selectedFile is not null or undefined, it means a file has been chosen.
javascript
Copy code
const reader = new FileReader();
Here, you're creating a new instance of the FileReader object. This object provides methods for reading the contents of a file asynchronously.
javascript
Copy code
reader.onload = function (event) {
This line sets up an event handler for the load event of the reader. This event is triggered when the reading operation is successfully completed. The anonymous function inside will be executed when the event occurs.
javascript
Copy code
const fileData = event.target.result;
Inside the load event handler, this line retrieves the contents of the loaded file. The result property of the event.target object holds the data read from the file.
javascript
Copy code
uploadFileToServer(fileData);
This line calls the uploadFileToServer function and passes the fileData as an argument. This is where you would typically send the file data to a server for processing or storage.
javascript
Copy code
reader.readAsDataURL(selectedFile);
This line initiates the reading of the selected file. The readAsDataURL() method reads the contents of the file as a data URL, which can be used to represent binary data in a URL-friendly format. The result will be available in the event.target.result property when the reading is complete.
javascript
Copy code
} else {
    alert('Please select a file.');
}
If no file is selected, this block of code displays an alert notifying the user to select a file before attempting to upload.
javascript
Copy code
});

function uploadFileToServer(fileData) {
    // You need to implement this function to handle uploading the file to your server.
    // You can use AJAX, Fetch API, or any other method to send the file data.
    // Server-side code is required to handle the file storage on the server.
    // This example focuses on the client-side part.
    console.log('Uploading file to the server...');
}
This is the uploadFileToServer function that you would need to implement. It's a placeholder for the server-side logic to handle the actual file upload. This function is called with the fileData argument, which represents the contents of the selected file.
The provided code is an example of handling file selection and initiating the upload process on the client side. Actual file storage and handling on the server side would require separate server-side code and technologies.
